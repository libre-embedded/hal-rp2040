              When 1, enable the cache. When the cache is disabled, all XIP accesses
                              will go straight to the flash, without querying the cache. When enabled,
                              cacheable XIP accesses will query the cache, and the flash will
                              not be accessed if the tag matches and the valid bit is set.
                              If the cache is enabled, cache-as-SRAM accesses have no effect on the
                              cache data RAM, and will produce a bus error response.

              When 1, writes to any alias other than 0x0 (caching, allocating)
                              will produce a bus fault. When 0, these writes are silently ignored.
                              In either case, writes to the 0x0 alias will deallocate on tag match,
                              as usual.

          - name: POWER_DOWN
            description: |-
              When 1, the cache memories are powered down. They retain state,
                              but can not be accessed. This reduces static power dissipation.
                              Writing 1 to this bit forces CTRL_EN to 0, i.e. the cache cannot
                              be enabled when powered down.
                              Cache-as-SRAM accesses will produce a bus error response when
                              the cache is powered down.

        fields:

            description: |-
              Write 1 to flush the cache. This clears the tag memory, but
                              the data memory retains its contents. (This means cache-as-SRAM
                              contents is not affected by flush or reset.)
                              Reading will hold the bus (stall the processor) until the flush
                              completes. Alternatively STAT can be polled until completion.

                              flag allow its level to be ascertained.

                              a linear data block from flash to the streaming FIFO.

                              read, so that a new stream can immediately be started (after

          (read-write) FIFO stream data
                      Streamed data is buffered here, for retrieval by the system DMA.
                      This FIFO can also be accessed via the XIP_AUX slave, to avoid exposing
                      the DMA to bus stalls caused by other XIP traffic.
