          (read-write) DMA Channel Transfer Count
                      Program the number of bus transfers a channel will perform before halting. Note that, if transfers are larger than one byte in size, this is not equal to the number of bytes transferred (see CTRL_DATA_SIZE).
                      When the channel is active, reading this register shows the number of transfers remaining, updating automatically each time a write transfer completes.
                      Writing this register sets the RELOAD value for the transfer counter. Each time this channel is triggered, the RELOAD value is copied into the live transfer counter. The channel can be started multiple times, and will perform the same number of transfers each time, as programmed by most recent write.
                      The RELOAD value can be observed at CHx_DBG_TCR. If TRANS_COUNT is used as a trigger, the written value is used immediately as the length of the new transfer sequence, as well as being written to RELOAD.

              HIGH_PRIORITY gives a channel preferential treatment in issue scheduling: in each scheduling round, all high priority channels are considered first, and then only a single low priority channel, before returning to the high priority channels.
                              This only affects the order in which the DMA schedules channels. The DMA's bus priority is not changed. If the DMA is not saturated then a low priority channel will see no loss of throughput.

                              This reduces the number of interrupts to be serviced by the CPU when transferring a DMA chain of many small control blocks.

                              Channel interrupts can be routed to either of two system-level IRQs based on INTE0 and INTE1.
                              This can be used vector different channel interrupts to different ISRs: this might be done to allow NVIC IRQ preemption for more time-critical channels, or to spread IRQ load across different cores.
                              It is also valid to ignore this behaviour and just use INTE0/INTS0/IRQ 0.
