      Controls time and alarms
              time is a 64 bit value indicating the time in usec since power-on
              timeh is the top 32 bits of time & timel is the bottom 32 bits
              to change time write to timelw before timehw
              to read time read from timelr before timehr
              An alarm is set by setting alarm_enable and writing to the corresponding alarm register
              When an alarm is pending, the corresponding alarm_running signal will be high
              An alarm can be cancelled before it has finished by clearing the alarm_enable
              When an alarm fires, the corresponding alarm_irq is set and alarm_running is cleared
              To clear the interrupt write a 1 to the corresponding alarm_irq

          (read-write) Indicates the armed/disarmed status of each alarm.
                      A write to the corresponding ALARMx register arms the alarm.
                      Alarms automatically disarm upon firing, but writing ones here
                      will disarm immediately without waiting to fire.
