              Controls the number of delay stages in the ROSC ring
                              LOW uses stages 0 to 7
                              MEDIUM uses stages 0 to 5
                              HIGH uses stages 0 to 3
                              TOOHIGH uses stages 0 to 1 and should not be used because its frequency exceeds design specifications
                              The clock output will not glitch when changing the range up one step at a time
                              The clock output will glitch when changing the range down
                              Note: the values here are gray coded which is why HIGH comes before TOOHIGH

                              The system clock must be switched to another source before setting this field to DISABLE otherwise the chip will lock up
                              The 12-bit code is intended to give some protection against accidental writes. An invalid setting will enable the oscillator.

        description: |-
          (read-write) The FREQA & FREQB registers control the frequency by controlling the drive strength of each stage
                      The drive strength has 4 levels determined by the number of bits set
                      Increasing the number of bits set increases the drive strength and increases the oscillation frequency
                      0 bits set is the default drive strength
                      1 bit set doubles the drive strength
                      2 bits set triples drive strength
                      3 bits set quadruples drive strength
